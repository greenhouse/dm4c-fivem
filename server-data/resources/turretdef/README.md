# turretdef for CitizenFX

This turretdef project has been automatically generated by the CitizenFX resource template.

To edit it, open `turretdef.sln` in Visual Studio.

To build it, run `build.cmd`. To run it, run the following commands to make a symbolic link in your server data directory:

```dos
cd /d [PATH TO THIS RESOURCE]
mklink /d X:\cfx-server-data\resources\[local]\turretdef dist
```

Afterwards, you can use `ensure turretdef` in your server.cfg or server console to start the resource.

# FiveM Simple Police Spawn Project

A simple FiveM C# project with the following features:
- Police officers spawn at a fixed GPS location (100, 100, 30) with pistols.
- Player starts with a pistol, 1-star wanted level, and unlimited ammo.
- Commands `/level1` to `/level5` set police spawn speed (5s to 25s) and wanted level (1 to 5 stars).
- HUD shows kill count and current level in bottom-right corner.
- Notification pops up for 5 seconds on level change (e.g., "Level X Increase").
- Every 10 kills, player unlocks a stronger weapon (Pistol -> Assault Rifle -> Sniper Rifle).

## Installation
1. Create a new folder in your FiveM server's `resources` directory (e.g., `myresource`).
2. Copy all files into this folder.
3. Add `ensure myresource` to your `server.cfg`.
4. Restart the server or use `refresh` and `start myresource`.

## Usage
- Join the server; you'll start with a pistol and 1-star wanted level.
- Use `/level1` to `/level5` in the F8 console to change level and spawn speed.
- Kill police to increase kill count; every 10 kills unlocks a new weapon.
- HUD in bottom-right shows kills and level; notifications appear on level changes.

## Notes
- Police spawn at `Vector3(100, 100, 30)`; modify in `client.cs` if needed.
- Weapon progression: Pistol (0 kills), Assault Rifle (10 kills), Sniper Rifle (20 kills).
- Unlimited ammo is enabled for all player weapons.
